# OCaml By Example

I think OCaml concepts are pretty hard to learn for the average joe. So these are basically my notes as I learn OCaml myself. However what I would really like is for people to submit their own examples in the form of a pull request.

This is loosely based off the [Go by example](https://gobyexample.com/).

The idea of these tutorials is:
- They are orginized primarily by __tasks__ to accomplish (enforcing things with types) NOT by the language concepts (abstract types) although we could provide a index to find those things more easily.
git push -u origin master
- They are made to be mostly stand alone examples. If they can't be they refrence other examples as
- Most of the dialog are in code comments.
- Everything should run UNLESS your trying to make a point. (enforcing things with types)
- They are made to be as simple as possible. The thing being taught should be the only thing in the file teaching. 

# Orginization
The First folder is __tasks__. This contains a title of something that you want to learn, like `working_with_files`, then the subfolders are substeps like `1.open_a_file` then `2.lazy_loading_a_file`

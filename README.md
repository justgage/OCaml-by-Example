# OCaml By Example

I think OCaml concepts are pretty hard to learn for the average joe. I personally learn very well by example and didn't find somthing quite to my liking. 

The idea of these tutorials is:
- They are orginized primarily by __tasks__ accomplish (enforcing things with types) NOT by the language concepts (abstract types) although we could provide a index to find those things more easily.
- They are made to be mostly stand alone examples. If they can't be they refrence other examples as
- Most of the dialog are in code comments.
- Everything should run UNLESS your trying to make a point.
- They are made to be as simple as possible. The thing being taught should be the only thing in the file without a lot of side teaching.
